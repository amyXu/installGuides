#Installation Guide - Java and Android Studios
***
This is an installation guide for Hack Western Students. These installations were tested the weekend before and are therefore very likely to be stable at the time of hacking. We hope you enjoy the event!
##Getting the Java Development Kit - Linux/Mac
First [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) the JDK and extract it. If using Linux follow [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-JDK-on-Ubuntu-Linux) tutorial, if using mac use [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-the-JDK-%28Java-Development-Kit%29-on-Mac-OS-X) tutorial.

##Getting the Java Development Kit - Windows
1. First [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
 the file under "Java SE Development Kit 8u40". Choose x64 or x86 depending on your OS.
2. Run the .exe that your just downloaded. [instructions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html) See "Running the JDK Installer"
3. Set the java environment variable. See "Updating the PATH Environment Variable" from above link.

##Getting Android Studios
1. Download it [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
2. Install instructions [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio).
3. Cry when things probably don't work. Googling your errors or going to StackOverflow is your best method of debugging by yourself. However, I recommend you just come and find a mentor for help.

##Adding Android SDK Packages
Android SDK comes with a lovely tool called "Android SDK Manager". If you ever need to download files related to android, this is your one stop location where you can download everything. This tool can be opened via android studio.
[This](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html) describes how to use it. 
#### Makes sure you download the necessary files from the SDK Manager.

If you are on windows, finding the "SDK Manager.exe" can be a pain sometimes. Search your computer for "SDK Manager.exe" or "adb.exe". Alternatively, you can check "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\bin" or "C:\Users\YourNameHere\AppData\Local\Android\sdk". Unfortunately, "AppData" is hidden by default. Go [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7) to make folders visible.
