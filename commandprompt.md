***
This is an installation guide for Hack Western Students. These installations were tested the weekend before and are therefore very likely to be stable at the time of hacking. We hope you enjoy the event!
## Change Directory
To open the command prompt, press the windows button and search either "cmd" or "command prompt". Select "cmd.exe", "Command Prompt" or anything to that effect and a black window will pop up. This is command prompt.

This command is the most important:

	cd path/to/your/folder

This is how you move around through folder. The "path/to/your/folder" you must change to be specific to your file system. So if I wanted to move to forward in the file system, add the name name of the folder you want to go to. To move backwards through files, use ".." as in:

	cd ..

You this command to see the files and folders in your current directory:
	
	dir
